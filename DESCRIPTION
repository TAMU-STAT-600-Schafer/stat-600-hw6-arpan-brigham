Description: Implimenentation for the Lloyd algorithm of K-means for a given number of iterations, the function is wrapped in R but the main workings are in C++. It also includes an implimentation for Multi-class logistic regression using damped Newton's method for parameter estimation. Again the overall function is wrapped in R but the implimentation is done in C++ for speed.
